Huge decrease in total cost of tasks INVENTORY_COST and LOTS_FOR_ITEM.
LOWEST_PRICES seems to be the same. Maybe that is because of the query that still accesses each cell of database.

Big increase in total cost of each tasks.
Seems like I didn't really pick good partition method. Or I have put bad parameters.
